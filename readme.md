# Fate Atom

A roleplaying game.

This game is openly developed. [Join in on GitHub](https://github.com/acodispo/fate-atom-rpg).

## The Basic Game

Each player: write down a name and a few *aspects*. This is your character.

*Aspects* are narrative facts about your character.

In order to play, describe what your character is doing. Decide together what happens next, based on these descriptions (or narratives).

If you cannot decide what happens, roll the dice.

Roll 4 Fudge dice. Fudge dice are six-sided dice with two sides each labelled with + and -, and two blank sides.

If one (or more) of your aspects applies, add +1 to the roll for each applicable aspect.

An *opposition* is another player's total. A *difficulty* is a static number, i.e. 1 is not difficult at all, 5 is quite difficult.

If you equal or exceed the opposition or difficulty, you get to describe what happens.

Yes, if you equal another player's total, you both get to describe what happens. Good luck.

## Supplement 1: Fate Points

Each player gets a few fate points (3 is a good number) at the start of your session of play.

If the dice are rolled and you don't like the outcome, you can:

1) Describe how an aspect comes into play.
2) Hand a fate point to the opposing player (in case of opposition), or throw it into a communal pool (in case of difficulty).
3) Reroll the dice, or add 2 to your standing total.

## Supplement 2: Adding a Game Master

Designate one player as the game master (hereafter "GM").

Everybody except the GM has narrative control over a single character, called a player character (hereafter "PC").

The gamemaster takes responsibility for the world the PCs inhabit. You make decisions and roll dice for every character in the game world who isn't a PC. These characters can be called non-player characters (hereafter "NPCs").

If Fate Points are being used (see Supplement 1, above), you have an unlimited store of fate points.

If the dice are rolled and you as GM feel that an aspect comes into play in such a way as to negatively effect a character, offer that character's player a fate point. If they accept it, subtract 2 from their total.

## Appendix 1: Alternatives to Fudge Dice

If you don't have any Fudge dice, you can use the every-day sort of six-sided dice. Just read 1 and 2 as -, 3 and 4 as blank, and 5 and 6 as +.
